# In this example, we have THREE calculators, the two included in the previous
# exercises as well as Whiz Bang Calculator that can even calculate the hypotenuse
# of a triangle if given the length of the other two sides. Figure out how to
# DRY up all the code below - there shouldn't be a single method duplicated between
# any two classes.

module SimpleCalculator

  def add(first_number, second_number)
    first_number + second_number
  end

  def subtract(first_number, second_number)
    first_number - second_number
  end

  def multiply(first_number, second_number)
    first_number * second_number
  end

  def divide(first_number, second_number)
    first_number / second_number
  end

end

    Math.sqrt(number)

    Math.hypot(first_number, second_number)
  end

    total = 1
    exponent_number.times { total = multiply(total,first_number) }

# Copy your driver code from the previous exercise and more below:

calc = WhizBangCalculator.new

p calc.add(1, 2)

p calc.subtract(5, 1)

p calc.multiply(20, 20)

p calc.divide(50, 5)

p calc.square_root(144)

p calc.hypotenuse(3, 4)

p calc.exponent(6, 2)
